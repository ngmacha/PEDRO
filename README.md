# PEDRO
Source code for the PEDRO robot

This is an arduino project, so you should open it and compile using the arduino IDE.
Just keep all files in the same folder, and open Pedro.ino in the arduino IDE. You may have to link
the RF24 library using the IDE library tool. You may also need to install the CH340 serial driver to communicate
with the robot's arduino ( instructions--  https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html ).
Have Fun!
